//! How round the app's corners are: one user setting, **Corner roundness**, that every rounded
//! surface draws through — from square, through as designed, to twice as round.
//!
//! A call site keeps the radius it was designed with and asks for it at the user's roundness:
//! `dvui.CornerRect.all(core.corners.scaled(8))`, or by name — `surface`, `card`, `control`,
//! `row`, `small` — for the sizes the app shares. Anything meant to be fully round (a pill, a dot)
//! is not a radius but a shape, and stays as it is. dvui's own widgets take their corner from the
//! theme, which the host scales by the same factor when it applies one.
//!
//! **One value everywhere.** The host publishes the setting into the shared dvui window each
//! frame (`publish`); a plugin dylib's copy of this file reads it from there, the way it reads the
//! dialog style and `core.motion`.
